            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.The International Standard
                Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education
                systems.[16] In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the fields were later
                separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels,
                created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest
                level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which
                target children below the age of 3 years.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the
                United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for
                education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at
                achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.Formal education
                is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary
                school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.Formal education occurs in a structured
                environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a
                school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified
                teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern
                all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design
                of the physical learning spaces (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment,
                class size, educational activities, and more.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for
                all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                education than in all of human history thus far.
